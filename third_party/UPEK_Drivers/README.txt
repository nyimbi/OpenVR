Nyimbi,
I have good news. Our team in US has progressed significantly on the PerfectPrint Open Source library and this is under qualification today in our European R&D / Q&A team. If all is well, we will give you the Open Source during this afternoon / evening.

 

Does your team have an Eikon Touch 300 device at your disposal that you could test with on your side once you have integrated? There should be a few devices available with Zinox Technologies in Abuja, hopefully they could provide you with one unit?
